  This callback should return a list of triplets ("arch-os-abi") for all supported targets
  of the given operation.

  For the `:compile` operation, `all_supported_targets` should return a list of targets that
  the current host is capable of (cross-)compiling to.

  For the `:fetch` operation, `all_supported_targets` should return the full list of targets.

  For example, GitHub Actions provides Linux, macOS and Windows CI hosts, when `operation` is
  `:compile`, the precompiler might return `["x86_64-linux-gnu"]` if it is running in the Linux
  CI environment, while returning `["x86_64-apple-darwin", "aarch64-apple-darwin"]` on macOS,
  or `["amd64-windows", "x86-windows"]` on Windows platform.

  When `operation` is `:fetch`, the precompiler should return the full list. The full list for
  the above example should be:

      [
        "x86_64-linux-gnu",
        "x86_64-apple-darwin",
        "aarch64-apple-darwin",
        "amd64-windows",
        "x86-windows"
      ]

  This allows the precompiler to do the compilation work in multilple hosts and gather all the
  artefacts later with `mix elixir_make.checksum --all`.

  This callback will be invoked when the user executes the `mix compile`
  (or `mix compile.elixir_make`) command.

  The precompiler should then compile the NIF library "natively". Note that
  it is possible for the precompiler module to pick up other environment variables
  like `TARGET_ARCH=aarch64` and adjust compile arguments correspondingly.

  There are two reasons that the current target might be unavailable:
  when the library only has precompiled binaries for some platforms,

  - needs to be compiled on other platforms.

    The callback should return `:compile` for this case.

  - is intended to function as `noop` on other platforms.

    The callback should return `:ignore` for this case.
